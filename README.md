# Interactive Scenarios Script

This repository contains `main.py`, an English interactive script that
implements eight small scenarios using basic control flow and input
parsing. The script is numbered: each scenario prints its number before
prompting the user.

## Usage

```powershell
python main.py
```

## Scenarios

1. Restaurant menu lookup and sushi price check
2. Weather message with optional umbrella advice
3. Student grade classification
4. Password validation
5. Friend list / name checks
6. Movie suitability by age and genre
7. Online purchase promo application
8. Transport recommendation based on distance and time

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+

If you want the script non-interactive (take arguments) or returned as
callable functions for import, tell me and I will refactor it.
